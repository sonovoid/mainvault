I look forward to receiving the Information I requested in the Mail.
Unless we receive the documentation by next Monday, we will have to prolong the deadline.
Although we discussed this before, lets have another meeting next Thursday.
Please find attached my resumee.
Thank you for your call on June 3rd.
Please submit your offer before the 21st of July.
Unfortunately, I will not be in the office in 10 days.





Dear John, 

I hope this email finds you well and am writing in regard to your E-Mail. 
I'm afraid that the costs are simply too high for us to reach the quality targets.
Unfortunately, making any changes to our electronic system will only further increase the costs.
Please give me a call as soon as you are available this afternoon.
I would also request for us to have a meeting on either Wednesday or Thursday to discuss and specify any potential changes.
Please find the breakdown of the original costs in the attached .pdf-File.

Thank you in advance. I will be looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards
Tom
