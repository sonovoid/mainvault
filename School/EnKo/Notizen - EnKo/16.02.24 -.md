Dear John, 
I am writing in regard to your E-Mail. 
I'm afraid that the costs are simply too high for us to reach the quality targets.
Unfortunately, making any changes to our electronic system will only further increase the costs.
Please find the breakdown of the original costs in the attached .pdf-File.
