1. Welcome
Today me and Lasse are going to talk about Identity Theft.
Many of you might have been exposed to it already, but today, we're going to break it down for you. 
2. Table of Content
I will start out by talking about Identity Theft as a whole, theft techniques, consequences and protection.
Then Lasse will tell you about access controls, education and awareness
3. Identity Theft
In our current age, identity theft is a growing concern in the IT environment, posing serious risks to organizations and individuals.
This stealthy threat can jeopardize sensitive data, undermine system security and lead to devastating financial and reputational consequences.
4. Understanding Identity Theft
Identity Theft occurs when someone steals your personal information to commit fraud or other crimes.
This can lead to unauthorized access to, for example, your financial accounts and significant personal and financial trouble.
Thieves may use various tactics, including phishing scams, data breaches and physical theft of documents to obtain your sensitive information.
5. Common Identity Theft Techniques
As I've just mentioned, and many groups before us. A valid way to steal information is by Phishing:
Let me recap what Phishing was: Its about criminals sending fraudulent emails or messages posing as legitimate organizations to trick victims into revealing sensitive information.
6.Common Identity Theft Techniques
Other ways, which also have been mentioned by other groups are:
Data Breaches: Where hackers illegally access and steal personal data from companies and organizations, exposing it to identity thieves.
or
Malware Attacks: Where malicious software can be used to infiltrate systems and collect sensitive data without the user's knowledge
7. Common Identity Theft Techniques
Furthermore, as I've already mentioned, one may use Physical Theft, where the criminal steals for example a wallet, documents or devices containing personal information to exploit it for their own gain.
Skimming Devices, you might have heard about this one, where thieves install small hidden devices on for example ATM machines or payment terminals to capture card information and PINs, usually with a camera to capture the PIN input.
8. Impact of Identity Theft
Identity theft may have devastating consequences, both financially and personally. Victims may face stolen funds damaged credit score and the troublesome task of restoring their identity and reputation.
The physical toll can be immense, leading to feelings of violation, stress and a loss of trust in various digital systems.
9. Protecting Sensitive Information
First of all, Data Encryptions:
You can protect yourself against identity theft by implementing robust encryption protocols to protect sensitive data, making sure that even if leaked or breached, that the information stays unreadable to people that aren't supposed to see it.
Access controls:
Enforcing strict access policies, granting only absolutely necessary access permissions to employees based on their role and task, limiting the exposure of sensitive data.
10. Protecting Sensitive Information
Moreover you may use secure storage,
like a cloud based storage solution with multiple authentication layers to prevent unauthorized access to mitigate the risk of physical theft or data loss.
Regular backups,
Maintaining backups of critical data ensures that a business may continue to use critical information in the event of a data brach or incident, which also caused data loss.
